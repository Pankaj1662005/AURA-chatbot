# üí¨ AURA: Conversational AI with Falcon-7B

AURA is a simple interactive chatbot built using the [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) model via Hugging Face's Transformers library. This chatbot keeps track of the conversation and responds contextually.

---

## üìå Features

- ü§ñ Based on Falcon-7B-Instruct LLM
- üí¨ Multi-turn conversation support
- ‚ö° Optimized with `bfloat16` for faster inference (if supported)
- üîß Automatic device mapping (GPU/CPU)
- üß† Simple, readable codebase

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aura-chatbot.git
cd aura-chatbot
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install torch transformers accelerate
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

Run the chatbot with:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will enter an interactive session like:

```
> Hello
AURA: Hi there! How can I assist you today?
```

To stop the conversation, simply use `Ctrl + C`.

## üßæ Code Breakdown

```python
model = "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)
```

- Loads Falcon-7B-Instruct with tokenizer
- Sets up generation pipeline with device auto-mapping and bf16 precision
- Maintains a conversation history in a list and feeds it as a prompt
